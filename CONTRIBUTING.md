## Versioning

`beulogue` follows my own FibVer (Fibonacci Versioning):

* Basically, it follows Semantic Versioning.
* You have to use Fibonacci suite numbers when you bump the version.
* Until you bump a major version, don't reset patch. For a version, it gives an idea of how many features and bugfixes you made.

I'll spec that one day...
