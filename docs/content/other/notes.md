`beulogue` is an experiment to discover the [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) programming language, 2 years after playing with [the same concept with Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beulogue).

`beulogue` aims to stay simple and provide the following for the first version:

- [x] mardown files to html pages
- [x] basic templating (pages)
- [x] basic templating (list)
- [x] markdown front-matter
- [x] multilingual site
- [x] rss
- [x] cli, help & debug

And maybe at some point:

- [x] tags (in front matter)
- [x] shortcodes
- [x] links between languages
- [x] orphan pages
- [ ] tags (pages)
- [ ] drafts

And probably won't:

- [ ] pagination

And absolutely won't:

- [ ] livereload
